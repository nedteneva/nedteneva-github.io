I am a Machine Learning Research Scientist at Megagon Labs and a Lecturer in Machine Learning at UC Berkeley and Southern Methodist University. In 2017-2022 I was as a Machine Learning Manager at Amazon working on Machine Learning and Information Retrieval aplications for Amazon Alexa. I hold a PhD in Computer Science from the University of Chicago where I was advised by Risi Kondor. My PhD work focused on applying harmonic analysis to matrix factorizations and large graphs drawing on ideas from functional analysis,numerical linear algebra & randomized algorithms. Generally, my interests revolve around Machine Learning and its applications to large, real world datasets. I have prior experience working with biological datasets and have more recently applied Machine Learning to signal & audio processing tasks (at Lyric Labs/Analog Devices in Cambridge, MA) and text & natural language processing tasks (at the Amazon Core ML Team in Berlin, Germany). Prior to graduate school, I received a BA from Colgate University, where I studied molecular biology and computer science. I grew up in Bulgaria.
